- Discussed with Richard from ZTE regarding a frontend 403 error. This issue occurred because the frontend used authinfo with an invalid CID (channel ID) when requesting the manifest file from the ZTE manipulator. The error occurred on the ‘Workpoint’ channel, which uses CID V0015. However, according to Richard’s query, the request using authinfo contained CID V0022, which resulted in the 403 error. Richard ZTE will investigate further with AMT team.
- Ask Nuch to allow the CORS origin for MW dev/SIT for Yuexin (AMT)’s request.
- tracing this issue with Pengyi from AMT regarding the Monomax channel Sport 42 being unavailable. We found that the channel had an invalid configuration: it was using the AIS staging packager instead of the Monomax origin staging. Pengyi updated the configuration in the ZTE SMS portal to resolve the issue.

- K.Tah from ZTE Thailand Support raised an issue where the image was not updated after the Content Curation team made changes. He will coordinate with the operations team to purge the image using  P.Poch’s tool.
- K.Namprathai asked about the issue. We found that it was caused by a ‘hostname cannot be resolved’ error. I suggested that she further check which DNS the STB is using and why this error occurs.
- received https://mbs-svc.3bbtv.com:8443/drm/token from K.Kla (JAS). I am testing it and then shared the details with Yuexin as an interim solution for the Monomax concurrency issue.
- Supported P. Eak and P. Ton (Content Curation Team) in completing the Paramount questionnaire.
- K.Kangwan raised a case regarding an HTTP 403 error. NPAW logs show applogintype: HBA, apperrorname: 80250002, and apploginstatus: Fail when accessing https://commonvdomw.cloud.ais.th/v1/cm/distro?device=hp&&platform=oncloud. 
  After investigation, Natkitta confirmed that the issue was caused by the IP not being allowed on the WAF.
- Yuexin raise that the Axinom license DRM server rejected when using Airplay. Still finding the cause.

- Review SSAI and virtual channel document.
- The issue that occurred yesterday, raised by K.Kangwan—an HTTP 403 error where NPAW logs showed applogintype: HBA, apperrorname: 80250002, and apploginstatus: Fail when accessing https://commonvdomw.cloud.ais.th/v1/cm/distro?device=hp&&platform=oncloud—has been investigated and the root cause has been identified. 
  This error was caused by a WAF block.
- Confirm Mac from operation team to stop 'lightweight' service.
- Meeting with K.Meng Sukrit regarding the Irdeto re-solution and Irdeto configuration. The Irdeto ‘BID’ functions like a parent folder, and the content is associated with an ‘EPID’ and a ‘protection profile’.
  K.Meng would like to change the BID to use the CP ID.
  After discussion, we agreed that each content item will be associated with only one EPID initially.
8JAN26
- daily meeting with JAS/MONO team. Confirm the Cognito API and deleteSession API with Cao ZTE.
- Updated the Vidaa CSP questionnaire with additional information.
- review SSAI and FAST (virtual channel) POC test case.
- Meeting with ATEME for Pilot Media presentation.
- K.Oat from Trinergy create Vantage new flow to transcode the content with subtitle.
- investigate VO log for case Tizen 6.0
  Suspect root Cause: Tizen 6.0 triggers a second video license request ~1.4 seconds after the first one, but the 4-minute delay logic blocks it, causing the CDM to `timeout-fail` while waiting for a license that never comes.
  Fix: Allow immediate license retry when duplicate requests occur within a short timeframe, or bypass the delay logic when `timeout-fail` status is detected.
9JAN26
- Allow New AMT China HK: 156.59.98.47, 210.245.146.136 to staging Redfox CDN.
- Meeting to discuss how to investigate the hotel issue. Below are the tasks that need to test and investigate
	  - Rewrite the manifest to handle missing data to avoid **Error 2000 (OutOfIndex)**.
	  - Rewrite the application to verify whether all required mp data is properly received.
	  - We checked which source (mp3, mp2 and mp1) is reported in NPAW when errors occur during requests. For this case, N.Koi has already verified the behavior.
	  - When only mp3 is blocked, NPAW reports the resource as mp1, and mp3 appears in the error metadata. When mp3, mp2, and mp1 are all blocked, NPAW reports three error sessions, and the resources shown are mp1, mp2, and mp2 in sequence. This happens because after retrying mp1—which is the last available MP—the application cannot retry further, so NPAW logs the resource as mp2.
	  - This has already been verified: repeatedly selecting the same channel generates multiple NPAW sessions.
	  - Investigate **Decode Fail: Codec 4003** errors.
	  - For **memory-related errors**, coordinate with the ZTE team.
- testing request 'esTokenFordeleteSession' API that provided by JAS team, it's working.

- P. Rose discussed a solution for emergency broadcast messages (such as earthquake alerts). AIS plans to distribute these messages via AIS PLAYBOX. The solution will leverage S3, and OVP will collect the list of customers from S3 and process the emergency broadcast messages.
- Meeting with FMTS. A sample code for using a watermark in the Cast receiver was provided to K.Wow. I will bring it to N.Fray(Rujipat) to try.
- Blocking on Chromecast process
  The two entitlement endpoints use different, non-interchangeable cognitoToken (staging-entitlement-ais.monomax.me with concurrency_limit=1 and mbs-svc.3bbtv.com:8443 with concurrency_limit=2), and since the API to generate esTokenForDelSession is currently deployed only on mbs-svc.3bbtv.com:8443, we cannot generate it on the staging endpoint with limit=1, preventing meaningful testing; therefore, to allow the AMT team to continue development, we either need JAS to deploy the esTokenForDelSession API on staging-entitlement-ais.monomax.me or reduce the concurrency limit of mbs-svc.3bbtv.com:8443/drm/token to 1. Already summarize and send to K.Kla (JAS team)
