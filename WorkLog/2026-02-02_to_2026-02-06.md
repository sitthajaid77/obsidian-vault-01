# WorkLog Week 06 (2026)

**Period:** 02 Feb 2026 to 06 Feb 2026

---

## 02Feb26
- Migrated pending tasks and blocked items from Week 05.
- 

---

## 03Feb26
- Logged STB Error Code 60004 (Entitlement Service Blocked) in [[kb-stb/error-code]] and [[kb-stb/drm]].
- [Investigating] Follow up with Cao (ZTE) regarding player optimization for handling incomplete manifest cases.
- **Chromecast routing to Huawei CDN (Solution Discussion with Cao ZTE):**
	- **Issue:** ZTE cannot use custom headers to inform RS-EPG for CDN selection due to CORS issues in their 'RS' module.
	- **Interim Solution:** Chromecast will use `deviceType` = `web` when requesting RS-EPG and NPAW. This allows Chromecast to be routed to Huawei CDN (which does not validate 'user-agent').
	- **Timeline:** This solution will be used before the official web client launch (targeted May 2026).
	- **Permanent Fix:** ZTE must deploy a new version of the 'RS' module to fix the CORS issue. After the fix, Chromecast will revert to using custom headers for CDN selection.

## 04Feb26
- [Completed] **Staging CDN 502 Bad Gateway (Redfox 905 edge → 903 midtier):** Root cause: NGINX on 903 midtier (58.64.56.250:8008) was not running because `load_module` directives for NDK and Lua in `/etc/nginx/modules-enabled` were commented out; NGINX failed at startup on Lua directives. Fixed by re-enabling modules and starting NGINX; request returned HTTP 200. Documented in [[kb-cdn/staging-cdn-502-midtier-nginx]].
- [Root Cause Identified] iPhone/iPad error -12927 during Dolby live channel switching - CDN cache key collision
  - **Investigation method:** N.Faii built iOS test app with ZTE manipulator to test playback with/without DRM
  - **Finding:** Mono29 eng-audio-init.mp4 contained DASH (Widevine/PlayReady) CENC encryption instead of FairPlay
  - **Root cause:** Varnish CDN vcl_hash configuration normalizes profile names (DD4, HD4F, etc.), causing DASH and HLS-fMP4 init segments to share same cache key
  - **Impact:** CENC init.mp4 (for Widevine/PlayReady) served to HLS FairPlay clients, causing audio playback failure
  - **Proof:** SHA-256 hash comparison confirmed DD4 and HD4F init.mp4 are byte-for-byte identical
  - **Recommended fix:** Exclude init segments from profile normalization in Varnish configuration
- [Investigating] Follow up with Cao (ZTE) regarding vertical 4K content black bar on STB (below screen). Documented VisualOn explanation and integer-multiple scaling workaround in [[kb-stb/vertical-4k-black-bar]].

---

## 05Feb26
- Video meeting (morning)
- [Handover] STB hotel version task handed over to N.Namprathai. She is coordinating with other teams (FBB-NOC/Sell, Cao ZTE) and still in the middle of setup process flow.
- **PPTV Office Meeting — BMS & MAM Platform Overview:**
	- **BMS/MAM:** Platforms for managing broadcast flow.
	- **Recording:** Source recorded in FHD for broadcast; low-res for web application or preview.
	- **Storage (NetApp):**
		- **Online:** 50 TB — content for daily use.
		- **Nearline:** 300 TB — files moved here when no longer in use.
	- **MAM selection focus areas (PPTV suggestions):**
		- How we want to use media
		- How many media will come to MAM
		- Which outputs need to receive the file
		- How long we need to keep the file
	- **MAM platform:** Most use Vizrt.

## 06Feb26
- **SRA Meeting (P.Wow, Cao ZTE, Almario Deloitte):**
	- **Topic:** SRA (Security Risk Assessment) — frontend project has many vulnerability issues after moving to CI/CD that uses CheckMarx tool.
	- **Action:** ZTE and AMT need to fix vulnerabilities and push code to repository; CI/CD will run CheckMarx to verify fixes.
	- **My role:** Follow Cao (ZTE) or Jax (AMT) to request their teams push code; monitor CheckMarx portal to verify vulnerability status.
- [In Progress] SRA — Follow ZTE/AMT to push vulnerability fixes; monitor CheckMarx portal.
- **Meeting (P.Aes, P.Wow, Pun):** 2026 project assignment.
- **FMTS weekly meeting (afternoon):**
	- **Task:** ZTE/AMT and FMTS to investigate why Xiaomi STB does not show watermark.
	- **Raised by:** N.Ked
	- **My role:** Follow with David (FMTS) and Jax (AMT).
	- **Update (David FMTS):** FMTS will purchase Mi Box for testing; will try to get same model (1st gen) as we have.
- [Investigating] Xiaomi STB watermark not showing — follow David (FMTS) and Jax (AMT); issue raised by N.Ked. **Progress:** David (FMTS) — FMTS will purchase Mi Box (1st gen) for testing.

## Week Summary

### Key Accomplishments
- Resolved staging CDN 502 (Redfox 905→903 midtier): NGINX on midtier was down due to commented load_module for NDK/Lua; re-enabled and started NGINX. See [[kb-cdn/staging-cdn-502-midtier-nginx]].
