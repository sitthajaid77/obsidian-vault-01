## 26Jan26
- **Samsung TV vertical VOD duration mismatch issue update:**
	- **Decision:** Content Curation Team will re-transcode the VOD content to fix audio/video track duration mismatch
	- **Next action:** AMT will test again after re-transcode is completed
	- **Status:** Waiting for Content Curation Team to complete re-transcode
	- **Date Updated:** 2026-01-27 - Content Curation Team completed re-transcode, now waiting for AMT team to test
- [completed] **DRM license 403 error for Monomax channel 502 - KID mismatch issue resolved:**
	- K.Kla successfully fixed the issue
	- DRM license can now be requested normally
	- Yuexin AMT confirmed the issue has been resolved
	- **Status:** Completed
- **Orion monitoring integration proxy service update:**
	- K.Kla and P'New successfully developed the proxy service between Orion and Axinom DRM
	- Proxy service has been delivered to Orion team
	- **Status:** Blocked - waiting for Orion team to test and confirm the integration
	- **Next action:** Follow up with Orion team on test results
- **MW on-cloud to ADMD timeout issue investigation:**
	- Morning meeting with P'Om (CCOE) and K.Duan (AWS Thailand team) to investigate timeout between MW on-cloud and ADMD
	- **Current Status:** Issue has resolved itself today
	- **Action plan agreed:**
		- Schedule test from EC2 instance with same subnet as EKS node
		- Nuch will create pod to schedule test from IP 2nd subnet
		- Work instruction (WI) already provided to P'Rose
	- Related to previous TLS SNI issue
- **DRM key rotation 1-day test - Configuration update issue found:**
	- **Test scenario:** Disable DRM → wait 2 days (esToken in frontend clears) → enable DRM again → DRM becomes key rotation 1 day
	- **Testing by:** Ked Somsiri
	- **Issue found:** Some devices experience app freeze
	- **Root cause:** Some devices do not receive configuration updates from ZTE SMS portal when config changes from non-DRM to DRM
	- **Interim solution:**
		- Restart STB (power off/on)
		- OR kill app and reopen
	- **Meeting outcome:** Agreed to proceed with interim solution
	- **Next action:**
		- Investigate with ZTE/AMT why some devices fail to update configuration
		- Need to understand configuration update mechanism from ZTE SMS portal to devices
- **STB CICD - CodeQL integration issue:**
	- **Issue:** "Use of a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm (DES3Util)" detected by CodeQL
	- **Status:** AMT pushed new STB code version with fix to branch dev
	- **Problem:** CodeQL detection occurred, but no CodeQL configuration exists in `.github/workflows`
	- **Action:** Asked AIS DevOps team how to add CodeQL scan step to STB CICD workflow
	- **Next action:** Wait for AIS DevOps team response on CodeQL integration guidance
	- TODO: Follow up AIS DevOps team on CodeQL workflow configuration
	- TODO: Follow up with ZTE/AMT on device configuration update issue

## 27Jan26
- [completed] **DocMost Space & PLAY bot:**
	- Nuch discussed with Jack CCOE team
	- Decision: Use the same space as UAT phase
	- **Status:** Completed
- **Samsung TV vertical VOD duration mismatch issue update:**
	- Content Curation Team has completed re-transcode
	- Checked re-transcoded content - **problem still persists**
	- **Investigation findings:**
		- Compared source file vs after transcoded file
		- Found: After transcoded file has different video and audio ranges (not aligned)
		- Root cause appears to be in the transcoding process itself
	- **Action taken:** Sent both source file and after transcoded file to K.Oat (Trinergy) to investigate
	- **Status:** Investigating - Root cause identified (transcoding process issue)
	- **Blocked by:** K.Oat (Trinergy)
	- **Waiting for:** K.Oat to check the files and provide analysis on video/audio range mismatch
	- **Date Updated:** 2026-01-27
- [completed] **STB CICD - CodeQL integration - 3DES issue resolved:**
	- ทาง Vendor (AMT) ทำการ push code STB dev มาใหม่ แต่ไม่มี CodeQL integration อยู่ใน Workflow file
	- มอบหมายให้ Koi เพิ่ม CodeQL integration เข้าไปใน `.github/workflows` ของ STB dev repository
	- Related: CodeQL detection issue ที่เคยพบก่อนหน้านี้ (DES3Util cryptographic algorithm)
	- **Outcome:**
		- Latest version of STB code has fixed the 3DES (DES3Util) issue
		- Koi successfully implemented CodeQL integration in the CI/CD workflow
		- CI/CD pipeline is running successfully
		- Problem has been marked as fixed in GitHub Security tab
	- **Status:** Completed
	- **Date Updated:** 2026-01-27
- **Chromecast user-agent customization issue:**
	- **Background:** AMT team reported they cannot customize "user-agent" headers for Chromecast
	- **Impact:** Need Redfox to bypass user-agent validation logic for Chromecast
	- **Proposed solution by P.Joke:** Use only "Huawei CDN" for Chromecast traffic
		- Benefit: Small user group, easier to control and monitor
		- Requires: ZTE manipulator logic modification
	- **Required action:** Discuss with Cao (ZTE) about implementing logic: "if application is Chromecast, ZTE manipulator needs to rewrite segmentURL to Huawei CDN"
	- **Status:** Investigating - Need discussion with ZTE
	- **Next action:** Schedule meeting with Cao (ZTE) to discuss Chromecast CDN routing logic
	- **Date Updated:** 2026-01-27

## 28Jan26
- **Chromecast routing to Huawei CDN - Solution discussion with Cao ZTE:**
	- **Background:** Follow-up from 27Jan26 - discussed with Cao (ZTE) about routing Chromecast traffic to specific Huawei CDN
	- **Proposed solution by Cao:**
		- Cast receiver needs to report that the client is "cast receiver" to ZTE EPG
		- ZTE EPG will return playbackURL to manipulator with query params pointing to Huawei CDN
	- **Status:** Blocked - Waiting for Cao to discuss with Yuexin AMT and his team
	- **Blocked by:** Cao ZTE
	- **Waiting for:** Cao to discuss solution details with Yuexin AMT and his team, then provide further implementation details
	- **Expected:** TBD
	- **Date Updated:** 2026-01-28
