# WorkLog Week 07 (2026)

**Period:** 10 Feb 2026 to 16 Feb 2026

## 12Feb26
- **Huawei CDN (production, no user-agent validation):** Told N.Krit (operation team) to create Huawei CDN that does not validate 'user-agent' on production. New domain name: `hwznua.play-rbcdn.ais.co.th`. N.Krit will create the domain name and inform Huawei team to process further.
- **Status updates:** (1) Tizen 6.0 streaming — N.Tew (LAB) finished testing; next: discuss with ZTE team for deploy of fixed template. (2) Samsung TV vertical VOD duration mismatch — Content Curation Team rendered new source file; waiting AMT team to test. (3) Chromecast Huawei CDN long-term — ZTE team completed deployment of new 'RS' module version.
- **iPhone/iPad error -12927 (CDN cache key collision):** P.Sompoch and Teohong team will develop the Varnish init-segment fix in Redfox CDN staging first.
- **AWS Inspector — Node 24 Docker image:** Asked Nuch to check via AWS Inspector whether a Docker image with Node version 24 has critical or high issues. Nuch will build a Docker image with Node 24, push to AWS ECR, and run the scan with AWS Inspector.
- **AWS Inspector Node/ECR scan outcome:** Trial results — Node v24 does not fix the CVE in ECR scan; Node v25 has no issues (fixes OpenSSL CVE) but is not LTS. Decision: use Node v22 and accept risk. Node.js advisory states "Node.js does not use CMS APIs", so CVE-2025-15467 does not affect Node.js; OpenSSL 1.1.1/1.0.2 not affected; Node will include fix in regular release. Documented in [[kb-mw/node-ecr-openssl-cve]].
